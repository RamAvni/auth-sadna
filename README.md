<h1 align="center">Auth Workshop</h1>

<p align="center">
Hello!
</p>

In preparation for working with `@hilma/auth` we are going to implement the basic basics of it ourselves!

We will do a follow-along of [NestJs' authentication tutorial](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication)
<hr />

This repo acts as a basis for the tutorial, and will serve us in doing it.
  
Beyond the `server` for this workshop, pretty much nothing else is needed!

(Oh, fun, of course. Be sure to bring fun with you)
